# ROS-random-number-average
This program contains a publisher and subscriber script. The publisher advertises random numbers at a frequency of 1Hz, and the subscriber outputs the average of the two floating points

When starting up a new terminal to run a node, remember to run source ./devel/setup.bash in the catkin_ws you created to source the necessary ROS files before running the listener and talker cpp files
